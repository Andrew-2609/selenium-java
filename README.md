# Basic Selenium + Java project

This is a very basic Selenium project that I made using Java. With this code, you can basically visit websites and do
assertions, but you can do a lot more cool things with Selenium.

## What is Selenium?

Selenium is an open-source umbrella project for a range of tools and libraries aimed at supporting web browser
automation. Selenium provides a playback tool for authoring functional tests without the need to learn a test scripting
language.

This means you can build automated tests that do pretty much the same thing with any of the most popular programming
languages (e.g. Python, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, etc.).

## How to run the tests

You can run the tests of this project by simply using `mvn test` command on the terminal (naturally, you must have Maven
installed).

If you are using IntelliJ IDEA, or any other suitable IDE, you can probably run the tests without the terminal.

## Finally...

You can find a lot more information about this topic by googling Selenium. Also, there are a lot of courses about this (
free and paid) that you can find in course platforms such as Udemy.

The course I watched to build this simple project, for example, can be found in
here: [Selenium WebDriver with Java Quickstart](https://www.udemy.com/course/selenium-webdriver-page-objects/)

However, I must say that this repository uses **different versions** of the dependencies used in the course (which you
can find in `pom.xml`). So, if you don't want to spend an extra time searching solutions on Google, I recommend you
using the same versions of dependencies show in the course. You just need to keep in mind that they are outdated.
